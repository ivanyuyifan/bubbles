# 🫧 Bubbles: A Linguistic Playground

> A personal lab of small ideas, mini-projects, and NLP-driven linguistic experiments.

Welcome to **Bubbles**, a collection of my personal linguistic projects powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), corpus analysis, and computational creativity. I'm a linguistics student passionate about language data, translation, and sociolinguistic phenomena—and this is where my curiosity turns into code.
