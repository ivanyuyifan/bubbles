# 🫧 Bubbles: A Linguistic Playground

> A personal lab of small ideas, mini-projects, and NLP-driven linguistic experiments.

Welcome to **Bubbles**, a collection of my personal linguistic projects powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), corpus analysis, and computational creativity. I'm a linguistics student passionate about language data, translation, and sociolinguistic phenomena—and this is where my curiosity turns into code.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m currently an English major at Beijing Forestry University with a strong interest in corpus linguistics, psycholinguistics, and NLP (computational linguistics). I love experimenting with language data and building tools or visualizations that make language patterns come alive. Btw I'm going to Uconn as an exchange student to further learn cutting-edge knowledge. Fighting!
