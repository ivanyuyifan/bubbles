# 🫧 Bubbles: A Linguistic Playground

> A personal lab of small ideas, mini-projects, and NLP-driven linguistic experiments.

Welcome to **Bubbles**, a collection of my personal linguistic projects powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), corpus analysis, and computational creativity. I'm a linguistics student passionate about language data, computer science, and sociolinguistic phenomena—and this is where my curiosity turns into code.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am an English major at Beijing Forestry University with a strong interest in corpus linguistics, psycholinguistics, and NLP. I enjoy experimenting with language data and building computational tools and visualizations to explore linguistic patterns.
I previously studied as an exchange student at the University of Connecticut, where I was exposed to advanced coursework and research in linguistics, psychology, language disorders, and brain–language mechanisms. This interdisciplinary training shaped my current research direction and methodological preferences.
In September, I will begin my master’s studies at the Neurolinguistics Lab, School of Foreign Languages, Shenzhen University. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, linguistics and cognitive science. I develop corpus-driven and algorithmic methods to model linguistic complexity, discourse structure, and cognitive load, with applications to AI-generated text and brain–language research.
